Have you ever wondered what is functional programming?
This big buzz word everyone is talking about?

## What is Functional Programming?

In **Functional Programming** everything is implemented using functions.

Functions are pieces of code which may receive some **input value**(parameters) and may return some **output value**.

In this case we have the `say_hello`  function which has no **parameters** and no **output value**, this function prints to the screen "hello world".

**Rust Example:**
```rust
fn say_hello(){
    println!("hello world");
}
```

**Haskell Example:**
```haskell
say_hello = putStrLn "hello world"
```

And in this case we have the function `add_one` which has an **input value** `num` of the type `i32` and returns that value plus 1.

**Rust Example:**
```rust
fn add_one(num:i32) -> i32{
    return (num + 1);
}
```

**Haskell Example:**
```haskell
addOne x = x+1 
```

## Why use Functional Programming?

Functional programming is one of the **simplest** programming paradigms and in most cases it's **speed** is unmatched by the other programming paradigms, such as Object Oriented Programming.

The implementations are often cleaner and more concise, and it allows the developers to think about a problem in other angle.
