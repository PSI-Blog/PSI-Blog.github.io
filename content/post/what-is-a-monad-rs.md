Have you ever wondered what the hell is a Monad? If yes this post will explain it to you like you're five.

## What is a monoid?

Let's see: 

If you have studied math you have seen symbols like this $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{R}$, or $\mathbb{Q}$. This are just groups of numbers.

A monoid just is a **set/semi-group** of numbers like this, with an **identity** element (let's call it $I$).

For example the operator (**+**):

If we have a set of numbers: $\mathbb{M} = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]$

<!-- The (**+**) operator uses 2 parameters **a** and **b**. -->

For every $x$ in $\mathbb{M}$ 

$x + I = x = I + x$

If you watch closely you can see that the identity element $I$ can be presumed to be 0, so:

$x + 0 = x = 0 + x$

The monoid
