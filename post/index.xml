This big buzz word everyone is talking about?
What is Functional Programming? In Functional Programming everything is implemented using functions.
Functions are pieces of code which may receive some input value(parameters) and may return some output value.
In this case we have the say_hello function which has no parameters and no output value, this function prints to the screen &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo;.
Rust Example:
fn say_hello(){ println!(&amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot;); } Haskell Example:
say_hello = putStrLn &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; And in this case we have the function add_one which has an input value num of the type i32 and returns that value plus 1.</description></item><item><title>X Could not find Module `Prelude` fix</title><link>https://psi-blog.github.io/post/prelude_ghc_fix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 02:27:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://psi-blog.github.io/post/prelude_ghc_fix/</guid><description>Today I was experimenting with Haskell and this error struck me:
X Could not find Module Prelude
There are files missing in the base-x-x-x package,
This has an easy fix:
Install the ghc-static package
sudo pacman -S ghc-static Then all should compile easily.</description></item><item><title>Emacs Multiple Dictionaries</title><link>https://psi-blog.github.io/post/emacs-dictionary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 03:19:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://psi-blog.github.io/post/emacs-dictionary/</guid><description>Emacs is really a nice tool to work with if you are a developer or even a writer. It&amp;rsquo;s modes are incredibly versatile and never cease to amaze me.
Some days ago I found myself in a conundrum, my Emacs config only supported one dictionary at a time.
Dictionary Plugins This dictionary plugins are really a life saver because they &amp;ldquo;lint&amp;rdquo; your text and help you find other words that are similar to the one you wrote incorrectly. Things that other code editors don&amp;rsquo;t have for writing $\LaTeX$ or Markdown
This is very frustrating if you write school papers/essays in your home language and write something in other language.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://psi-blog.github.io/post/first-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:27:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://psi-blog.github.io/post/first-blog/</guid><description>Hello there This is the first post of this blog and I would like to present myself:
My name is Diogo Val√©rio
I&amp;rsquo;m a first year Computer Science student
